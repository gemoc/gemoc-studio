defined and thus that its design is not part of the GEMOC xDSML process.
Nevertheless, the process could easily be extended with a new step
which consists in defining the AS and its Concrete Syntaxes (CS).</p></div><p>Once the AS is defined&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and possibly the CS ---, the execution
semantics of the DSML can be defined.   It includes the definition
of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">the <span class="strong"><strong>DSA</strong></span> (Domain Specific Actions) which includes EF (Execution
Functions) and ED (Execution Data): it defines the runtime data
and the actions to handle them,</li><li class="listitem">the <span class="strong"><strong>MOCC</strong></span> (Model of Concurrency and Communication) which deals with
concurrency aspects,</li><li class="listitem">the <span class="strong"><strong>DSE</strong></span> which maps DSA and MOCC,</li><li class="listitem">the <span class="strong"><strong>visualization</strong></span> which provides views to control and monitor the
execution of models conforming to the xDSML.</li></ul></div><p>There is no mandatory order in which these different parts have to be
built.  Thus, a first description of the process can focus on this
characteristic (<a class="link" href="ch03s02.html#GEMOC-process-overview" title="Figure&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;Overview of the GEMOC process">see overview process</a>).
The xDSML parts may be built in any order.
This process stresses a first step which consists in eliciting the
requirements on the expected execution semantics.  This
elicitation is not always easy to achieve for the system engineers,
thus we believe that providing samples of models as well as some
scenarios describing their execution is a good way
for system engineers to describe they expectations.</p><p>Furthermore, it is recommended to built the xDSML using increments and
iterations.  Increments address requirements the ones after the
others.  Iterations allow to rework the different components until the
requirements are fulfilled.</p><div class="figure"><a name="GEMOC-process-overview"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;Overview of the GEMOC process</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/tutorial/xDSML-definition-process-overview.png" alt="Overview of the GEMOC process"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e1976"></a>

are the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">It is <span class="strong"><strong>user-oriented</strong></span>.  Indeed, we believe that to build the right
xDSML, the end-users' expectations have to be handled in the first
place.  As GEMOC targets simulation of models, it is important to
elicit the expectations of the end-users, i.e. the system engineers,
in term of simulation of its models.</li><li class="listitem">It is <span class="strong"><strong>incremental</strong></span>.  All end-users expectations will not be
handled all at the same time but we recommend to define several increments
that will progressively includes these expectations seen as requirements.
The purpose is to make the definition of the execution semantics simpler
by gradually integrating the requirements, and thus the difficulties.</li><li class="listitem">It is <span class="strong"><strong>iterative</strong></span>.  For an increment, all the components will
certainly not be done right and complete at the first time.  Thus,
iterations will be necessary to tweak the definitions of the xDSML.
Examples provided by the end users will help in deciding whether an
iteration is finished or not.</li><li class="listitem">It is <span class="strong"><strong>highly concurrent</strong></span>.  Indeed, the main steps can be run at
the same time, possibly by different persons (even if it not always very
easy using Eclipse).  We can imagine that the DSE model and mappings can
be first defined to specify the overall architecture of the xDSML
semantics, including requirements on DSA as specification of the expected
execution functions and requirements on the MoCC as expected MoCC events
and relations on them.  The MoCC libraries, the DSA implementation and the
animator can then be developed at the same time, by different persons.
Of course the DSE model can still be changed and the others updated.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Recommanded GEMOC Process"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="sec-GEMOC-process"></a>Recommanded GEMOC Process</h3></div></div></div><p>An xDSML is a language that targets a specific purpose. When defining
such a language it is important to first identify that purpose so as
to build the right language.  Thus, we propose a methodology which
focuses on the end-user expectations --- why models are animated? ---
and then build the different parts of the xDSML to fulfill these
expectations.</p><p>In the context of the GEMOC project, the main aim is to be able to
animate and simulate heterogeneous models based on different xDSMLs.
Thus the end-user expectations will encompass the different xDSML
involved in the model to build.  This global process which includes
the dispatch of expectations on the different parts of a model will be
addressed in a future revision of this document when all constituents
will be further defined.</p><p>The main steps to achieve the definition of an xDSML according to the
GEMOC approach are described hereafter. They are summarized as a UML
activity diagram.  Package notation is used to group activities by
domain (and could be considered as a kind of compound activity).</p><div class="figure"><a name="GEMOC-process"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;3.2.&nbsp;Recommended GEMOC Process</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/tutorial/xDSML-definition-process-general.png" alt="Recommended GEMOC Process"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p><a class="indexterm" name="d0e2045"></a>

tutorial.  Nevertheless, it is possible to define an xDSML with other
processes depending on the background of the language designer, his
knowledge of the GEMOC approach, the considered DSML, etc.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;GEMOC xDSML definition tutorial with Automaton DSML&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="Guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Definition of the requirements/expectations on the xDSML</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
