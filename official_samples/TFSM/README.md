A timed Finite state machine is a language to specify the system behaviour where actions are divided into inputs and outputs. Time constraints limit the time at which an output has to be produced after an input has been applied. After this, the time variable is reset to zero. Moreover, a state can have a time invariant called time-out. If the time-out expires and no input is applied the system should change its state according to the specification. A special discrete clock variable is used in order to represent a timed behaviour.
