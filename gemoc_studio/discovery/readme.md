the catalog.md is build manually and is intended to be copied in the [GEMOC website](http://www.gemoc.org)GEMOC website by its [build.sh](https://github.com/gemoc/gemoc.github.io/blob/gh-pages-edit/build.sh) script.

This file is located here instead of directly in the site in order to have them both at the same location and simplify the manual synchronization.

May be in the future, we can write or retreive a tool that would generate is automatically...
